# Shared Peptides Explorer for Mass Spectrometry

A Shiny application and R tools to explore similarity between proteins and its effect on identification and quantification of in Mass Spectrometry based experiments.

The app can be accessed at ... TBA

Main functionalities:
  - listing tryptic peptides for a given set of proteins,
  - finding shared peptides,
  - interactive visualization of shared peptides,
  - comparison of theoretical and experimental results.
